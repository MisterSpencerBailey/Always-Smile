# Always-Smile
Chrome extension to redirect Amazon links to Amazon Smile links

[Amazon Smile](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/chpf/about/ref=smi_aas_redirect?ie=UTF8&%2AVersion%2A=1&%2Aentries%2A=0) is a system with Amazon where
a small portion of every eligible order will be donated to a charity of your choice. In order for the donation to occur, the order has to be done on 
`smile.amazon.com` rather than just `amazon.com`. As I often would forget to switch over to the Smile sub-domain, this extension will automatically
redirect me to Amazon Smile links.
